# nodejs-csv-data
Node.js server for the web controller and the contents routing. We will also persist and fetch data through CSV files by using a package (ya-csv) through NPM (Node Package Manager Registry). Finally, we will perform front end rendering with EJS (Embedded JavaScript), which also resides within the node package manager ejs module.
